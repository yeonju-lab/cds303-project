# Session 1 : Data Collection & Paper Understanding

## Data Description
I selected the dataset "Stock Portfolio Performance" from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
(Dataset source : http://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/390/stock+portfolio+performance)

The Stock Portfolio Performance dataset contains portfolio performance data generated from different stock selection
strategies using historical U.S. stock market data. The dataset includes financial return variables,
risk-related variables, and investment style indicators that describe the characteristics and performance of
stock portfolios.

## Three Main Categories of Variables

### Return-related Variables

These describe the profitability and performance of stock portfolios.

- Annual Return
- Excess Return
- Win Rate
- Abs. Win Rate
- Rel. Win Rate

### Risk-related Variables

These describe the level of market-related and overall investment risk.

- Systematic Risk
- Total Risk
- Small Systematic Risk

### Investment Style

These describe different stock selection and investment strategies.

- Large B/P
- Large ROE
- Large S/P
- Large Market Value
- Large Return Rate in the last quarter

## Research Motivation and Research Question

There are three disadvantages of weighted scoring stock selection models.
1. They cannot identify the relations between weights of stock-picking concepts and performances of portfolios.
2. They cannot systematically discover the optimal combination for weights of concepts to optimize the performances.
3. They are unable to meet various investors' preferences.

Therefore, this project aims to identify meaningful groups of stock portfolios based on financial return and risk
characteristics and explain the important features that distinguish different portfolio groups.

### Research Question
"How can stock portfolios be grouped based on return and risk characteristics,
and which variables make the portfolio groups different?
